# Difference between React's Old Approach and React Fiber

## Old Approach: Reconciliation with Virtual DOM

In the old approach of rendering with React, the reconciliation process involved the following steps:

1. **Virtual DOM Creation**: React creates a virtual representation of the UI known as the virtual DOM.
2. **Changes Detection**: When changes occur, React generates a new virtual DOM tree.
3. **Comparison**: React compares the new virtual DOM with the previous one to identify the differences.
4. **DOM Updates**: Based on the differences, React updates the actual DOM to reflect the changes.

## React Fiber

React Fiber represents a reimplementation of the reconciliation algorithm used in React, introducing several improvements:

1. **Incremental Rendering**: React Fiber allows React to split rendering work into smaller chunks, enabling interruption of rendering to handle high-priority updates without blocking the main thread.
   
2. **Improved Scheduling**: With React Fiber, updates can be prioritized and scheduled more effectively, ensuring critical updates are processed quickly while less important updates are deferred or batched.

3. **Support for Advanced Features**: React Fiber lays the groundwork for implementing advanced features such as asynchronous rendering, error boundaries, and suspense, enhancing the capabilities of React.

4. **Concurrent Mode Support**: React Fiber provides better support for concurrent mode, enabling React to work on multiple tasks concurrently for smoother interactions and improved performance in complex applications.

Overall, React Fiber offers significant improvements over the old reconciliation approach, providing better performance, flexibility, and support for advanced features while maintaining the basic principles of working with React.
